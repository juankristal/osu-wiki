## Mappools

_Mappools will be revealed one week in advance of each round_

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Ruleset

### Tournament Rules

1. The osu! World Cup is a country-based team tournament, played on the osu! game mode.
   - While this competition is planned as a 4 versus 4 setup, this might change depending on the amount of incoming registrations.
2. Beatmap scoring is based on Score V2.
3. The beatmaps for each round will be announced by the mapset selector in advance on the Sunday before the actual matches take place. Only these will be used during the respective matches.
   - One beatmap will be given as a tiebreaker beatmap. This beatmap will only be played in case of a tie. **The only exception to this is the Qualifiers pool.**
4. Match schedule will be settled by the Tournament Management (see below).
5. If no staff or referee is available, the match will be postponed.
6. Use of the Visual Settings to alter background dim or disable beatmap elements like storyboards and skins are allowed.
7. If the beatmap ends in a draw, the game will be nullified and the map will be replayed.
8. If a player disconnects, their scores will not be counted towards their team's total.
   - Disconnects within 30 seconds or 25% of the beatmap length (what happens first) after beatmap begin can be rematched. This is up to the referee's discretion. The played beatmap might be aborted for this.
9. Beatmaps cannot be reused in the same match unless the game was nullified.
10. If less than the minimum required players attend, the maximum time the match can be postponed is 10 minutes.
11. Exchanging players during a match is allowed without limitations.
   - **In the event that a map rematch is required, exchanging players isn't allowed. An exception can be made, up to the referee's discretion, if the previous roster is unavailable to play.**
12. Lag is not a valid reason to nullify a beatmap.
13. All players are supposed to keep the match running fluent and without delays. Excessive match delays coming from the player's side can be issued with penalties.
14. If a player disconnects between the beatmaps and the team can not provide an exchange, the match can be delayed 10 minutes at maximum.
15. All players and referees must be treated with respect. Instructions of the referees and tournament management is to be followed. Decisions labeled as final are not to be objected.
16. Disrupting the match by foul play, picking inappropriate warmup beatmaps (see below), insulting and provoking other players or referees, delaying the match or other deliberate inappropriate misbehavior is strictly prohibited.
17. The multiplayer chatrooms underlie the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules). All chat rules apply to the multiplayer chatrooms, too.
   - Breaking the chat rules results in a silence. Silenced players can not participate at multiplayer matches and must be exchanged for the time being.
18. **The seeding method will be revealed after all the teams have played their Qualifier rounds.**
19. Unexpected incidences are handled by the tournament management. Referees may allow higher tolerance depending on the given circumstances. This is up to their discretion.
20. Penalties for violating the tournament rules can be:
   - Exclusion of specific players for one beatmap
   - Exclusion of specific players for an entire match
   - Declaring the match as Lost by Default
   - Disqualification from the entire tournament
   - Disqualification from the current and future official tournaments until appealed
   - Any modification of these rules will be announced.
